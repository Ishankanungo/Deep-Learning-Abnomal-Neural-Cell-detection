* Detect and delineate distinct objects of interest in biological images depicting neuronal cell types commonly used in the study of neurological disorders.
* Unfortunately, segmenting individual neuronal cells in microscopic images can be challenging and time-intensive
* Accurate instance segmentation of these cells—with the help of computer vision—could lead to new and effective drug discoveries to treat the millions of people with these disorders
