### Introduction:

* Detect and delineate distinct objects of interest in biological images depicting neuronal cell types commonly used in the study of neurological disorders.
* Unfortunately, segmenting individual neuronal cells in microscopic images can be challenging and time-intensive
* Accurate instance segmentation of these cells—with the help of computer vision—could lead to new and effective drug discoveries to treat the millions of people with these disorders

## Why is segmenting individual neuronal cells difficult ?
* To develop cell instance segmentation models, the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y consistently exhibits the lowest precision scores out of eight different cancer cell types tested. 
* This could be because neuronal cells have a very unique, irregular and concave morphology associated with them, making them challenging to segment with commonly used mask heads.

## Modelling technique
We have used Detectron2 library by Facebook AI Research for object detection and segmentation.
* The Detectron2 model used, is based on the concept of maskR-CNN benchmark. 
* To input into the model, The images are augmented by changing the brightness, random flipping etc. 
* The Detectron2 uses a predefined instance segmentation architecture to train on the given annotated image dataset. 
* The predictor is then able to identify masks and delineate distinct objects of interest depicting neuronal cell types commonly used in the study of neurological disorders.

* The model utilizes a backbone network which is a predefined architecture from the Detectron2 Model zoo (in our case it is Resnet-50). 
* The model is trained using the COCO pre-trained weights. 
* The model then predicts by extracting features from the images, followed by the Region Proposal Network (RPN). The RPN then proposes the region boundaries and ROI heads are used for creating mask heads in the image output.
